Abstract = {{A new model is presented on how chemically driven cryovolcanism might
   contribute to episodic outgassing at the icy moon Enceladus and
   potentially elsewhere including Europa and Kuiper Belt Objects. Exposed
   water ices can become oxidized from radiolytic chemical alteration of
   near-surface water ice by space environment irradiation. In contact with
   primordially abundant reductants such as NH(3), CH(4), and other
   hydrocarbons, the product oxidants can react exothermically to produce
   volatile gases driving cryovolcanism via gas-piston forces on any
   subsurface liquid reservoirs. Radiolytic oxidants such as H(2)O(2) and
   O(2) can continuously accumulate deep in icy regoliths and be conveyed
   by rheological flows to subsurface chemical reaction zones over
   million-year time scales indicated by cratering ages for active regions
   of Enceladus and Europa. Surface blanketing with cryovolcanic plume
   ejecta would further accelerate regolith burial of radiolytic oxidants.
   Episodic heating from transient gravitational tides, radioisotope decay,
   impacts, or other geologic events might occasionally accelerate chemical
   reaction rates and ignite the exothermic release of cumulative
   radiolytic oxidant energy. The time history for the suggested ``Old
   Faithful{''} model of radiolytic gas-driven cryovolcanism at Enceladus
   and elsewhere therefore consists of long periods of chemical energy
   accumulation punctuated by much briefer episodes of cryovolcanic
   activity. The most probable sequence for detection of activity in the
   current epoch is a long evolutionary phase of slow but continuous
   oxidant accumulation over billions of years followed by continuous but
   variable high activity over the past 10(7)-10(8) years. Detectable
   cryovolcanic activity could then later decline due to near-total
   oxidation of the theologically accessible ice crust and depletion the
   accessible reductant abundances, as may have already occurred for Europa
   in the more intense radiation environment of Jupiter's magnetosphere.
   Astrobiological potential of Enceladus could correspondingly be higher
   than at Europa due to a less extreme state of oxidation and greater
   residual abundance of organics. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},
