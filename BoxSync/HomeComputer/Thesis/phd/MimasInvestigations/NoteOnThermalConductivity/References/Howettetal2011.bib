Abstract = {{Spectral maps of Mimas' daytime thermal emission show a previously
   unobserved thermal anomaly on Mimas' surface. A sharp V-shaped boundary,
   centered at 0 degrees N and 180 W, separates relatively warm daytime
   temperatures from a cooler anomalous region occupying low- to
   mid-latitudes on the leading hemisphere. Subsequent observations show
   the anomalous region is also warmer than its surroundings at night,
   indicating high thermal inertia. Thermal inertia in the anomalous region
   is 66 +/- 23 J m(-2) K(-1) s(1/2), compared to <16 J m(-2) K(-1) s(1/2)
   outside the anomaly. Bolometric Bond albedos are similar between the two
   regions, in the range 0.49-0.70. The mapped portion of the thermally
   anomalous region coincides in shape and location to a region of
   high-energy electron deposition from Saturn's magnetosphere, which also
   has unusually high near-UV reflectance. It is therefore likely that
   high-energy electrons, which penetrate Mimas' surface to the centimeter
   depths probed by diurnal temperature variations, also alter the surface
   texture, dramatically increasing its thermal inertia. (C) 2011 Elsevier
