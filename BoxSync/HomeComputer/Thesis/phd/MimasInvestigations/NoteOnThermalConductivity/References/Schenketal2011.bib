Abstract = {{New global maps of the five inner midsize icy saturnian satellites,
   Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, and Rhea, have been constructed in
   three colors (UV, Green and near-IR) at resolutions of 1 km/pixel. The
   maps reveal prominent global patterns common to several of these
   satellites but also three major color features unique to specific
   satellites or satellite subgroups. The most common features among the
   group are first-order global asymmetries in color properties. This
   pattern, expressed on Tethys, Dione and Rhea, takes the form of a
   similar to 1.4-1.8 times enhancement in redness (expressed as IR/UV
   ratio) of the surface at the center of the trailing hemisphere of
   motion, and a similar though significantly weaker IR/UV enhancement at
   the center of the leading hemisphere. The peak in redness on the
   trailing hemisphere also corresponds to a known decrease in albedo.
   These double hemispheric asymmetries are attributable to plasma and
   E-ring grain bombardment on the trailing and leading hemispheres,
   respectively, for the outer three satellites Tethys, Dione and Rhea,
   whereas as E-ring bombardment may be focused on the trailing hemisphere
   of Mimas due to its orbital location interior to Enceladus. The maps
   also reveal three major deviations from these basic global patterns. We
   observe the previously known dark bluish leading hemisphere equatorial
   band on Tethys but have also discovered a similar band on Mimas. Similar
   in shape, both features match the surface patterns expected for
   irradiation of the surface by incident MeV electrons that drift in a
   direction opposite to the plasma flow. The global asymmetry on Enceladus
   is offset similar to 40 degrees to the west compared to the other
   satellites. We do not consider Enceladus in detail here, but the global
   distribution of bluish material can be shown to match the deposition
   pattern predicted for plume fallback onto the surface (Kempf, S.,
   Beckmann, U., Schmidt, S. {[}2010]. Icarus 206, 446-457.
   doi:10.1016/j.icarus.2009.09.016). E-ring deposition on Enceladus thus
   appears to mask or prevent the formation of the lenses and hemispheric
   asymmetries we see on the other satellites. Finally, we observe a chain
   of discrete bluish splotches along the equator of Rhea. Unlike the
   equatorial bands of Tethys and Mimas, these splotches form a very narrow
   great circle <= 10-km wide (north-to-south) and appear to be related to
   surface disruption, exposing fresh, bluish ice on older crater rims.
   This feature is unique to Rhea and may have formed by impact onto its
   surface of orbiting material. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights
