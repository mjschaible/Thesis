Abstract = {{This study is concerned with energy transfer in porous water ice at
   large Knudsen numbers of the sublimated gas.  We present a formula for
   the effective thermal conductivity, lambda-eff, which is found to be
   valid for a wide range of material parameters, in particular also for
   high porosity materials, where other expressions for lambda-eff
   published in the literature lose their validity.  It is found that above
   approximately 190 K-lambda-eff increases strongly with temperature and
   depends mainly on the average grain size, while at low temperatures it
   is primarily controlled by the value of the Hertz-factor.  The influence
   of the porosity is relatively weak.  The reliability of our expression
   for lambda-eff has been checked by comparing computed temperature
   profiles with the temperature recordings of comet simulation
   experiments.  The predicted temperatures are in good agreement with the
   experimental results.  Finally, our model is applied to a typical
   surface layer of a cometary nucleus.  A strong temperature dependence of
   the effective thermal conductivity in cometary water ice is predicted.}},
