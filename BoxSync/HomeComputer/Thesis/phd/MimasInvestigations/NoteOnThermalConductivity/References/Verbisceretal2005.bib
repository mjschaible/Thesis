   observations at phase angles in the range alpha = 0.26degrees-6.4degrees
   obtained at every opposition and near quadrature between October 1996
   and December 2002 reveal the opposition effect of Enceladus. We present
   a photometric analysis of nearly 200 images obtained through the five
   broadband UVBRI filters (F336W, F439W, F555W, F675W, and F814W) and the
   F785LP and F1042M filters from which we generate mutually consistent
   solar and rotational phase curves. Our solar phase curves reveal a
   dramatic, sharp increase in the albedo (from 0.11 mag in the F675W
   filter to 0.17 mag in the F785LP filter) as phase angles decrease from
   2degrees to 0.26degrees. A slight opposition effect is evident in data
   from the F1042M filter (lambda(eff) = 1022 nm); however, the smallest
   phase angle currently available for observations from this filter is
   alpha = 0.58degrees. With the addition of data from the F255W filter we
   demonstrate the wavelength dependence of the albedo of the trailing
   hemisphere from 275 to 1022 nm. Our rotation curves show that the
   trailing hemisphere is similar to0.06 mag brighter than the leading when
   observed at wavelengths between 338 and 868 nm and 0.11 mag brighter
   than the leading at 1022 nm. We have supplemented the phase curve from
   the F439W filter (lambda(eff) = 434 nm) with Voyager clear filter
   (lambdaeff = 480 nm) observations made at larger phase angles (alpha =
   13degrees-43degrees) to produce a phase curve with the most extensive
   phase angle coverage possible to date. This newly expanded range of
   phase angles enhances the ability of the Hapke photometric model (Hapke
   B., 2002, Icarus 157, 523-534) to relate physical characteristics of the
   surface of Enceladus to the manner in which incident light is reflected
   from it. We present Hapke 2002 model fits to solar phase curves from
   each UVBRI filter as well as from the F785LP and F1042M filters.
   Geometric albedos derived from these model fits range from p = 0.92 0.01
   at 1022 nm to p = 1.41 +/- 0.03 at 549 nm, necessitating an increase of
   about 20\% from previously derived values. Our Hapke fits demonstrate
   that the opposition surge of Enceladus is best described by a model
   which combines both moderate shadow-hiding and narrow coherent
   backscattering components. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},
